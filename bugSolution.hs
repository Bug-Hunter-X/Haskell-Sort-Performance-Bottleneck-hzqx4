```haskell
import Data.List (sort)
import Data.Sequence (Seq(..), fromList, insert, toList)

-- Efficient sorting for extremely large lists using Data.Sequence
largeListSort :: [Int] -> [Int]
largeListSort xs = toList $ foldl' (
extSeq x -> insert x nextSeq) Empty (fromList xs)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1..10000000] -- A very large list
  let sortedNumbers1 = sort numbers -- Using Data.List.sort
  print $ take 10 sortedNumbers1 -- Print a small portion for demonstration 
  let sortedNumbers2 = largeListSort numbers -- Using efficient Data.Sequence based sort
  print $ take 10 sortedNumbers2 -- Print a small portion for demonstration
```
This solution utilizes the `Data.Sequence` library which can provide better performance and memory usage characteristics for very large lists compared to `Data.List.sort` by avoiding unnecessary data copying.  However, it's crucial to note that the optimal solution depends heavily on the specific characteristics of your data and application requirements.
